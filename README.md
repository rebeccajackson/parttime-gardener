# Parttime Gardener web app

This is one of my personal projects that is still a work in progress.  I use it as a platform to grow my skills and practice what I have learnt. 
Parttime gardener is designed to enable a user to see what vegetables to plant in each season/month.
A user can also register/login to then save vegetables to their garden

## Build process
- Initial build used Handlebars
- Learnt React and rebuilt from scratch
- After learning Redux I made a new branch, implimented the changes then merged it back to master
- I used this project to learn JWT web token login and register

## This current version of my project is built with

* Javascript
* React-redux
* SQLite3 
* Knex schema
* Enzyme and Jest testing
* CSS (Grid and Flexbox)
* JWT login
